                                <h1>About the Conference</h1>
                            </div>

                            <p>The European R Users Meeting, <a href="http://erum.io">eRum</a>, is an international conference that aims at integrating users of the R language living in Europe. Although the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/conferences.html">useR! conference series</a> also serve similar goals, but as it's alternating between Europe and USA (and more recently Australia in 2018), we decided to start another conference series in the years when the useR! is outside of Europe.</p>

                            <p>The first eRum conference was held in <a href="http://2016.erum.io">2016 in Poznan, Poland</a> with around 250 attendees and 20 sessions spanning over 3 days, including more than 80 speakers. Around that time, we also held another, although shorter conference in Budapest: the <a href="http://budapest.satrdays.org">first satRday event</a> happened with 25 speakers and almost 200 attendees from 19 countries. The eRum 2018 conference brings together the heritage of these two successful events: planning for 400-500 attendees from all around Europe at this 1+2 days international R conference.</p>

                            <p>The local Organizing Committee is lead by Gergely Daroczi, who chaired the Budapest satRday event as well. Just like the satRday series, eRum is also a nonprofit conference and driven by enthusiasm for open-source, R and the related community, so we make no financial gains and we do not get paid at all for working on this event.

                            <p>We also offer "Supporter" level tickets for around 30% extra over the "Industry" ticket prices to express your support for this event and the R community by making it possible for others without the requred financials to attend the event. We suggest this option for freelancers and smaller companies without a budget to become an official <a href="#sponsors">sponsor</a> of the conference. Note, that the "Supporter" level tickets provide the exact same features as any other ticket, the only extra feature is a special-colored badge to highlight your generous contribution.</p>
                            <h5 id="faq-ticket-types">Not sure which conference ticket to buy?</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We decided to keep the <i>student ticket</i> fees as low as possible (not even covering our catering and related expenses -- so heavily relying on our <a href="#sponsors">sponsors</a>' generous contributions) and affordable for students even without any salary. Pick this option if you are an actual full-time student <i>without</i> income letting you pick a more expensive ticket type</li>
                                <li>R users working in academia (eg higher education or research institutes etc) should pick the <i>Academic</i> option, which is still very reasonably priced and planned to be affordable for most European researchers, professors and PhD candidates -- hopefully covered by your institute</li>
                                <li>Everyone else with a full-time and paid job (or equivalent, eg freelancing) should pick the <i>Industry</i> option (which is still pretty affordable compared to past years' useR! and other conference ticket prices) -- hopefully sponsored or reimbursed by your employer</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5 id="faq-payment">What payment options are possible?</h5>
                            <p>Please note that by default, we only accept Paypal payments (eg debit or credit cards) to automate the administrative tasks related to ticketing and invoicing to reduce our costs at this nonprofit event and make it affordable for all attendees -- but on request, we can also provide a proforma invoice and accept postpaid wire transfer as well. <strike>Please note that this option requires us to charge ~10 EUR extra administration fee. If that's what you rather prefer (or have to do), then go ahead with the registration and pick the "Paper invoice or post-paid option" Invoice Type, fill in all your details, then use the "POSTPAID" Discount Code to check-out without paying via PayPal. Then we will send you the proforma invoice in a week and finalize your registration after the payment has cleared.</strike> Sorry, the post-paid option is not available in the last fews days of the registration.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, please note that wire-transfer payments are possible via PayPal as well, so if you would like to avoid paying the extra administration fee, you can also open a free PayPal account and do a wire-transfer there to top up your account, then register for the eRum conference using your PayPal balance -- so that's also possible without having access to a debit or credit card.</p>

                                        Being a Virchow Fellow at the Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, I can sit at the interface with many other disciplines and focus on translational bioinformatics. With platelets transcriptomics as a use case, I plan to develop packages and web applications for interactive and reproducible research in RNA-seq analysis and other -omics data.

                                <li><b>Keynote talk</b>: 45 mins invited, plenary (no parallel sessions) talk followed by 5 mins of Q&A in the main auditorium, potentially live-streamed on the Internet and to the other rooms at the conference venue.</li>
                                <li><b>Invited talk</b>: 18 mins invited talk followed by 2 mins of Q&A in one of the two main auditoriums, potentially live-streamed on the Internet.</li>
                                <li><b>Regular talk</b>: 18 mins contributed talk followed by 2 mins of Q&A in an auditorium, potentially live-streamed on the Internet.</li>
                                <li><b>Lightning talk (5min)</b>: variation of the pecha kucha and ignite formats with fixed number of 15 slides in an auditorium, followed by 1 quick question if time allows. The slides are auto-forwarding every 20 seconds.</li>
                                <li><b>Poster</b>: presenters bring their printed posters not exceeding 4' x 4' or 120cm x 120cm to be mounted on the wall or provided poster holder (with tools provided by the organizers) for 4 hours on the Monday night social event. Attendees can freely walk around in the dedicated Poster Session area to check the posters and chat with the presenters. The presenters are suggested to stand by or not too far from their posters to answer any question others might have and to grab all opportunities to speak about their presentation :) If you want to print your posters in Hungary, you can get it printed eg in CopyGuru.hu for around 25 EUR.</li>
                                <li><b>Demo</b>: 5 mins of freeform presentation in an auditorium on Monday night without any dedicated time for Q&A, but with a follow-up session in a dedicated area (with tables) of the Poster Session where the presenters can continue demoing their application to the interested attendees and answer questions etc.</li>

                                                <h3>Overview</h3>

                                                You’ve got the killer idea for an R package, but you’re not sure where to start? Then you’ve come to the right place!
                                                <br><br>
                                                During this workshop, we’ll go through the whole process of building a package that lasts. In other words, we’ll review the best practices to create a package that works (obviously), but more importantly a package that is extensively tested to prevent bugs, that will be easier to maintain on the long run, and that will be fully documented.
                                                <br><br>
                                                At the end of this workshop, the attendees will have a road map for writing robust packages, designed for industrial use and/or for CRAN.

                                                <h3>Plan of the workshop</h3>

                                                <h4>Goals</h4>
                                                By the end of the tutorial participants should be able to:
                                                <ul>

                                                <h4>Detailed Outline</h4>
                                                During the tutorial the participants will perform a guided data analysis task and make several refactoring steps as we progress. They will immediately experience the benefit of applying the shown techniques. The tutorial will cover launguage-agnostic and R-specific topics as well.

                                                </ul>
                                                Some R-specific topics covered:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>how to extract some ggplot2 layers into functions</li>

                                                <h4>Pre-requisites</h4>
                                                Participants should be able to create simple R functions and use R for data analysis. We believe the tutorial is useful for beginners as well as for more experienced R programmers.
                                                <h4>Justification</h4>
                                                Most R users do not have a formal background in software engineering, however, coding is a significant part of their job. We believe every R user can benefit from writing cleaner and simpler code which also makes it more reusable and less error-prone. Writing clean code also helps with reproducibility. Refactoring early and often makes the life of your future self and your collaborators as well as others wishing to understand your code easier.

                                                <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
                                                Participants should be familiar with for loops, if statements and writing simple functions.
                                                <h3>Justification</h3>
                                                R is now used in many disparate settings. However, the majority of R programmers have no formal computer training, and instead have "learned on the job". This tutorial aims to fill in some of these gaps.

                                                An analysis of CRAN maintainers in 2016 estimated that 11.4% were women <a href="http://forwards.github.io/data/">(http://forwards.github.io/data/)</a>. This proportion is much lower than the proportion of women that attended the R conference useR! in the same year (28%). In addition a survey of the participants at that useR! conference found that women were less likely than men to have experience of contributing to or writing packages <a href="http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/">(http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/</a>. Also women were less likely to use R recreationally, so perhaps have less opportunity to develop package development skills.

                                                This workshop is designed to address this skills gap. It is for women who have done some R coding and are ready to take the next step in providing it to others to use.

                                                The data.table package is a powerful tool for manipulating data, especially if the underlying data set gets large (~ above 1 GB). In spite of its clear advantages the package is underused. Many R users are afraid of it because of its "ugly" syntax. This workshop aims to dismantle this belief by showing the beauty in the package logic, and illustrating its strengths in performance.
                                                <br><br>
                                                By the end of the tutorial participants should be able to:
                                                <br><br>

                                                    <li>use data.table for common data manipulation tasks (data input/output, aggregation, reshaping, joins)</li>
                                                    <li>build on their understanding of data.table syntax to solve more complicated tasks</li>
                                                    <li>compare the performance of the package to other widely used alternatives</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <h3>Method</h3>
                                                The workshop would start with a short introduction into the logic and syntax of the data.table package. The participants would discover the power and beauty of the package through guided data manipulation tasks borrowed mainly from Emarsys use cases.
                                                <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
                                                Participants should be able to solve data manipulation tasks in R (using base R or the hadleyverse/tidyverse). No knowledge of the data.table package is required.

                                                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is just around the corner. The regulation will become enforceable a week after the eRum conference (from 25 May 2018). Are you and your organization ready to explain your models?
                                                <br><br>
                                                This is a hands-on tutorial for R beginners. I will demonstrate the use of two R packages, h2o &amp; LIME, for automatic and interpretable machine learning. Participants will be able to follow and build regression and classification models quickly with H2O's AutoML. They will then be able to explain the model outcomes with a framework called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME).

                                                <h3>Overview</h3>
                                            <p>Unstructured text data is rapidly increasing in volume and variety and with advances in Machine Learning it’s becoming available to be tapped for insights and patterns. One of the use-cases of predictive modelling in text analytics would be to classify an author based on text alone. However, even the most accurate model may be difficult to interpret and therefore understand how reliable it is or whether it produces insights that can be generalized. One of the solutions here is to apply the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework to the classifiers to generate interpretable explanations.</p>
                                            <p>In this workshop, we will take you step-by-step through the text-analytics pipeline to create a predictive model classifying tweets by Clinton or Trump. We will go over the data collection, exploration, feature engineering and model building. Finally, we will apply the LIME framework to better understand and interpret what drives model predictions.</p>

                                                <h3>Overview</h3>
                                                Complex machine learning models are frequently used in predictive modelling. There are a lot of examples for random forest like or boosting like models in medicine, finance, agriculture etc.
                                                <br><br>
                                                In this workshop we will show why and how one would analyse the structure of the black-box model.
                                                <br><br>
                                                This will be a hands-on workshop with four parts. In each part there will be a short lecture (around 20 minutes) and then time for practice and discussion (around 20 min).
                                                <br><br>
                                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                                Here we will show what problems may arise from blind application of black-box models. Also we will show situations in which the understanding of a model structure leads to model improvements, model stability and larger trust in the model.
                                                <br><br>
                                                During the hands-on part we will fit few complex models (like xgboost, randomForest) with the mlr package and discuss basic diagnostic tools for these models.
                                                <h4>Conditional Explainers</h4>
                                                In this part we will introduce techniques for understanding of marginal/conditional response of a model given a one- two- variables. We will cover PDP (Partial Dependence Plots) and ICE (Individual Conditional Expectations) packages for continuous variables and MPP (Merging Path Plot from factorMerger package) for categorical variables.
                                                <h4>Local Explainers</h4>
                                                In this part we will introduce techniques that explain key factors that drive single model predictions. This covers Break Down plots for linear models (lm / glm) and tree-based models (randomForestExplainer, xgboostExplainer) along with model agnostic approaches implemented in the live package (an extension of the LIME method).
                                                <h4>Global Explainers</h4>
                                                In this part we will introduce tools for global analysis of the black-box model, like variable importance plots, interaction importance plots and tools for model diagnostic.

                                                <h3>Overview</h3>
                                                If you don’t work at one of the big tech giants, then deep learning may seem out of reach. Fortunately, in recent years the barrier to entry has dropped dramatically. Libraries, such as TensorFlow, have made it much easier to implement the low level linear algebra. While Keras builds on this to provide a high level Python API specifically for building neural networks. A single data scientist can now quickly build a deep network, layer by layer, without losing time on implementation details. You don’t need terabytes of data and GPU clusters to get started; even relatively small problems can now benefit from deep learning.
                                                <br><br>
                                                A key aim of Keras is to reduce the time from idea to implementation. Many data scientists choose to use the R language for its first class statistics functionality, powerful data manipulation, and vibrant community. While Python is also a fantastic choice for data science, learning it is a significant investment when what you really want to be doing is trying out your idea. For this reason RStudio created the R Interface to Keras. This allows an R user to quickly experiment with neural networks to see if they are right for their problem.
                                                <br><br>
                                                In this workshop we will get you up and running with Keras for R. We will cover some theoretical background but the focus is on implementation. We will demonstrate how to setup different types of neural network to solve simple problems with time series, and give you the opportunity to build your own with guided exercises.
                                                <br><br>
                                                A cloud based RStudio Server environment will be provided so attendees only require a laptop with internet access and a modern browser. Basic R knowledge is required, and it will help if attendees are familiar with packages such as dplyr for data manipulation.

                                                <h3>Geocomputation with R</h3>
                                                Geographic data is special and has become ubiquitous. Hence, we need computational power, software and related tools to handle and extract the most interesting patterns of this ever-increasing amount of (geo-)data.
                                                <br><br>
                                                This workshop gives an introduction how to do so using R. It will introduce the audience how the two most important spatial data models - vector and raster - are implemented in R. The workshop will also give an introduction to spatial data visualization.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Maps are a compelling way to display complex data in a beautiful way while allowing first inferences about spatial relationships and patterns.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Additionally, we will bridge R with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), i.e., we show how to combine the best of two worlds: the geoprocessing power of a GIS and the (geo-)statistical data science power of R.
                                                <br><br>
                                                We will do so with a use case presenting spatial and predictive modeling.

                                                In this workshop you will learn how to plot spatial data in R by using the <b>tmap</b> package. This package is an implementation of the grammar of graphics for thematic maps, and resembles the syntax of <b>ggplot2</b>. This package is useful for both <i>exploration</i> and <i>publication</i> of spatial data, and offers both <i>static</i> and <i>interactive</i> plotting.

                                                <br><br>
                                                For those of you who are unfamiliar with spatial data in R, we will briefly introduce the fundamental packages for spatial data, which are <b>sf</b>, <b>sp</b>, and <b>raster</b>. With demonstrations and exercises, you will learn how to process spatial objects from various types (polygons, points, lines, rasters, and simple features), and how to plot them. Feel free to bring your own spatial data.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Besides plotting spatial data, we will also discuss the possibilities of <i>publication</i>. Maps created with <b>tmap</b> can be exported as static images, html files, but they can also be embedded in <b>rmarkdown</b> documents and <b>shiny</b> apps.
                                                <br><br>

                                                One of the biggest challenges for a data analyst is to ensure the reliability of the data since the validity of the conclusions from the analysis hinges on the quality of the input data. This tutorial will cover the workflow of data screening and -validation that transforms raw data into data that can be used for statistical analysis.
                                                <br><br>
                                                In particular, we will discuss organizing research projects, tidy data formats, internal and external validity of data, requirements for reproducible research, the <b>dataMaid</b> R package for customized data screening, the <b>assertr</b> and <b>assertive</b> R packages for data validation and data validation rule sets, and how to produce code books that summarize the final result of the data screening process and provide a starting point for the subsequent statistical analyses.</p>

                                                When people think of graphs, they often think about mapping out social media connections. While graphs are indeed useful for mapping out social networks, they offer so much more. Graphs provide a datastructure that scales very well and can be queried in intuitive ways. Data structures in the real world resemble vertices and edges more than they resemble rows and columns. <b>Gremlin</b> and <b>Cypher</b> are query languages that take advanatage of the natural structure of graph databases. In this tutorial I will show how we can use <b>igraph</b> in a similar manner as these graph query languages to get new insites into our data.

                                            <p>A common challenge in large-scale courses is that many variations of similar exercises are needed for written exams, online tests conducted in learning management systems (such as Moodle, Blackboard, etc.), or live quizzes with voting via smartphones or tablets. The open-source package exams for R (http://www.R-exams.org/) provides a one-for-all approach to automatic exams generation, tying together various open-source packages (in R and beyond). It is based on individual exercises for multiple-choice or single-choice questions, numeric or text answers, or combinations of these. The format can be either in R/LaTeX or R/Markdown containing questions/solutions with some random numbers, text snippets, plots/diagrams, or even individualized datasets. The exercises can be combined to exams and easily rendered into a number of output formats including PDFs for classical written exams (with automatic evaluation), import formats for various learning management systems, live voting (via ARSnova), and the possibility to create custom output (in PDF, HTML, Docx, ...).</p>
                                            <p>It is illustrated how the Department of Statistics at Universität Innsbruck manages its large introductory mathematics course using PDF exams that can be automatically scanned and evaluated, online tests in the OpenOLAT learning management system, and live quizzes in the ARSnova audience response system. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how psychometric item response theory (IRT) can be utilized to gain further insights into the difficulty of the questions, ability of the students, and the "fairness" of the exam across participants.</p>

This talk will describe a general framework to deal with such data, especially focusing on the unsupervised setting and exploratory analyses. Also, solutions for combining multiple relational data - each providing a different view on a specific aspect of the data - will be described. The talk will provide an overview of applications of this framework to self-organizing maps (R package SOMbrero), constrained hierarchical clustering (R package adjclust) and PCA (R package mixKernel), with illustrations on case studies in the fields of biology and social sciences.</p>

Understanding the original uses of S and R (in the 1900s), and seeing how these uses affected the development of R lets us appreciate the robustness of R's ecosystem. This keynote uses readings of the R sources and other information to explore R's history. The topics to be touched on include the "colour" books (brown, blue, white, green), interlinkages to SICP (Scheme) and LispStat, the lives of R-core and CRAN, Ancients and Moderns (see <a href="http://www.pieceofk.fr/?p=431">Exploring the CRAN social network</a>).</p>

                                            <p>Extracting semantic content from texts has a long history in statistics but it has become quite a popular theme very recently with the advent of social media, especially those like Twitter, which mainly dispatch text messages. Applications range from marketing to election forecasting, well being or happiness analysis, market mood, etc. Despite a huge development of automatic methods, NLP or ontology based algorithms, social media data are not as easy to analyze as one might think compared to the analysis of romance or other forms of digital texts. The reason being the creativity and continuous change of online language. Supervised methods seem to be the only option. We will present some recent theoretical developments and a series of real life applications of these techniques to Twitter and other big data.</p>

Through a partnership with a genealogical site, we have obtained almost a billion 'records'. In the first part of the talk, we will discuss those data, and how to study them, with R. The most difficult tasks is that most tree are ascendant (from children to grand parents), but when studying migration, we must have a descendant approach (from grand parents to children). Furthermore, since we use collaborative data, there are a lot of doublons, and most of them are difficult to track (typos). In the second part, we will discuss semiological aspects : how to visualize complex information, with R.</p>

                                            <p>Data science is often thought as carefully <em>building up</em> from data. However there are many cases where going the other away around, and <em>drilling down</em> into the data, can also be extremely useful. Have you ever seen a plot where something seems off? Maybe it's a few egregious outliers or a quirk in the expected trend. Instead of going back to the drawing board immediately, you can leverage the power of Shiny to allow you to interactively start from an aggregate visualization (or summary) and then drill down into the lower-level, finer-grained data. Whether it is by interactively creating new tabs, modal windows or other methods, <em>drilling down</em> allows you to discover data that's been right under your nose, without having to leave your Shiny app. In addition to <em>drilling down</em>, you can also <em>drill through</em> (by looking at snapshots of the data at different periods), and even <em>drill up</em> (by creating aggregate values from the underlying data). These capabilities allow for more satisfying data presentation or data reporting Shiny apps, since its consumers can investigate the data to their heart's content. In this talk, I will demo a mock personal finance Shiny app that takes advantage of functions like <code>insertUI</code>/<code>removeUI</code>, <code>appendTab</code>/<code>removeTab</code>, and <code>showModal</code>/<code>removeModal</code>.</p>

                                            <p>In this presentation, we provide an overview of the field of "Automatic Machine Learning" (AutoML) and introduce the AutoML functionality in the scalable and distributed machine learning library, H2O.  We will present our unique methodology for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes feature pre-processing and automatic training/tuning of many models, with the goal of maximizing model performance.</p>
                                            <p>H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates the process of training a large selection of candidate models without any user configuration or knowledge about specific machine learning algorithms.  The interface is designed to have as few parameters as possible so that all the user needs to do is point to their dataset, identify the response column and optionally specify a time-constraint.  The user can also specify which model performance metric that they'd like to optimize and use a metric-based stopping criterion for the AutoML process rather than a specific time constraint.  By default, several Stacked Ensembles will be automatically trained on the collection individual models to produce a highly predictive ensemble model which, in most cases, will top the AutoML Leaderboard.</p>
                                            <p>H2O AutoML is available in all H2O interfaces including the h2o R package, Python module and the Flow web GUI.  We will also provide simple R code examples to get you started using H2O AutoML.</p>

                                            <p>In programming, a <i>future</i> is an abstraction for a <i>value</i> that may be available at some point in the future. The non-blocking nature of futures makes them ideal for <i>asynchronous</i> evaluation of expressions in R, e.g. in parallel on the local machine, on a set of remote machines, or in the cloud.</p>
                                            <p>I am presenting the simple, unified, cross-platform future ecosystem for parallel and distributed processing in R. The most fundamental construct is <code>f <- future({ expression })</code> for evaluating the expression asynchronously and later in the program retrieve the value using <code>v <- value(f)</code>. How and when futures are resolved depends is specified by <code>plan()</code> without further modification of the R code. Higher level map-reduce constructs exists, e.g. <code>future_lapply()</code>, and doFuture backends for <code>foreach()</code>. The future framework, available on CRAN, has been used in production for several years.</p>

                                            <p>A data analyses may contain many steps where data is modified or corrected. For reasons of quality control and efficiency it is imperative to be able to understand the effect of each step on the final result. One way to do this is to somehow measure (log) the effect that each data processing step has on the data.</p>
                                            <p>The lumberjack package offers an elegant solution by endowing the function composition (pipe) operator with the capability of logging changes in data flowing through it. This means that the effect of any data processing function that adheres to the 'tidy' data-in-data-out style can be monitored almost effortlessly. The package offers several basic loggers as well as a framework for users and package authors to refine logging by defining their own loggers.</p>
                                            <p>In this talk I will go into the design principles behind the package, demonstrate the workflow, and show several examples of loggers that usefully summarize changes in data.</p>

                                            <p>Compositional data are nowadays widely accepted as multivariate observations carrying relative information. Compositional data follow the principle of scale invariance, typically being represented in proportions and percentages. In other words, for compositional data the relevant information is contained in the (log-)ratios between the components (parts). Compositional data are present in almost any field of research. Examples for compositional data are, for example, concentration of chemical elements in soil samples, time budget data, expenditures, tax or wage components or percentages and ratios reported in various tables.</p>

                                            <p>There is no need to praise Shiny for its influence on results presentation. It’s no longer only a tool internally used by data science teams. Currently it’s becoming an alternative for business and is replacing both the BI solutions and custom made web applications. In order to face the competition, it needs constant development and new features. As with many other technology stacks, Shiny could benefit from community contributions for further development of the packages themselves and growth of independent libraries.</p>
                                            <p>In this presentation we will talk about four novel packages that add interesting capabilities to Shiny such as beautiful UI <code>shiny.semantic</code>, <code>semantic.dashboard</code>, routing <code>shiny.router</code>, and internationalization <code>shiny.i18n</code>. All four packages have been developed to meet the needs that had to be addressed in business projects. This indisputably shows the gaps in the current Shiny capabilities that these packages fill. </p>
                                            <p>During the development process of the packages we took inspiration from proven frontend frameworks such as Meteor or Django.</p>
                                            <p>We will demo these packages and show how their development adds to the open source community, thereby helping companies adopt R/Shiny.</p>

                                            <p>The rise of data science has brought with it a high demand for data scientists. More companies than ever before are looking for the broad skillset of THE data scientist –or the ever out of reach unicorn-- but in reality, most data scientists are moving to the field from diverse backgrounds such as statistics, physics, chemistry, engineering and computer science. So, how does a company ensure their data science team has the right mix of skills to achieve their business goals? Ensuring the statistician has the software engineering skills they need and the computer scientist can understand advanced analytics are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
                                            <p>At Mango, we have been working with a number of companies, across different industries, to help them build their in-house data science capability - from completely new teams to teams already in place, looking to understand how to do data science in practice.</p>
                                            <p>So how do we build on the skills teams with diverse backgrounds already have? How can we use the capability of R to grow strong data science teams? In this talk we will discuss some of the approaches that we have taken at Mango to educate teams in everything from software development best practices to the intricacies of machine learning – all without leaving R!</p>

                                            <p>The development through the tests is a well-established methodology in the field of software engineering for several reasons:</p>
                                            <p>First of all, it validates the real functionality of what we are developing, and avoid regressions in the code functionality: in fact, the automatic tests are run frequently and every time that a new portion of code is added, they check that everything is still working as expected (and eventually point out where it's not going so) Secondly, tested code enables refactoring: it means that using tests you can modify the working code to improve its readability or abstraction without adding further functionality. This provides the re-usability of that code. Furthermore tests describe the code: clearly written tests in fact provide a working documentation of the low-level functionalities of the code being written Finally, Test Driven Development is a programming methodology that starts with the tests to describe the design of the code before it validates its functionality.</p>
                                            <p>However, this methodology has not yet established itself in the world of data science, even if RStudio and several others have already created tools for supporting the package development with automatic tests. Since validating code and making refactoring are very important qualities in data science, I would like to show within this talk how to use tests in the development of a data science project and what are the great advantages that it can lead, in term of clarity of the code, robustness and safeness of code changings.</p>

                                            <p>Plant protection products (PPP) including fungicides, herbicides and insecticides are amongst other factors an important stressor in aquatic ecosystems. We analyzed their seasonal occurrence patterns and possible related adverse effects on aquatic organisms in small running waters. Therefore more than 450.000 water chemistry samples had been collected by German federal agencies between 2005 and 2015. The data were processed in R, mostly by using the data.table-package, before they were uploaded into a relational PostgreSQL data base. For subsequent analysis of seasonal occurrence patterns of PPP in streams we used Generalized Additive Models (GAM) from the mgcv package.</p>
                                            <p>We hypothesized (i) to find increased in-stream occurrences of PPP during months of increased application. Likewise we hypothesized (ii) adverse effects on aquatic organisms to peak during, or shortly after periods of application. Furthermore we hypothesized (iii) to find a long-term decrease in occurrences of compounds, whose authorization has expired during or shortly before the monitoring period.</p>
                                            <p>We defined the occurrence of PPP as the number of detections per compound per month and sampling site. In order to quantify adverse effects of single PPP on different aquatic organism groups Toxic Unit (TU) metrics were used. They are calculated by dividing in-stream compound concentrations by endpoints of experimental toxicity tests. Such test data were obtained through large publicly accessible data bases. Additional data on chemicals were collected using the webchem package and data on organisms were accessed through the taxize package.</p>
                                            <p>We were able to trace seasonal patterns of PPP in small streams and draw conclusions on the effect on aquatic communities therein. With the help of the mentioned R packages and data base systems we were able to establish fast and reproducible procedures for the analysis of large environmental data sets.</p>

                                            <p>In this session I demonstrate how to use R to train and deploy deep learning models with TensorFlow and Keras. You can easily construct scalable data pipelines, train models, evaluate training runs, and deploy your models to a variety of platforms. Until recently these tools were Python centric, but using new R packages (provided by RStudio and available from CRAN), any R programmer can now easily use TensorFlow.</p>

                                            <p>We describe the package MSGARCH, which implements Markov-switching GARCH models in R with efficient C object-oriented programming. Markov-switching GARCH models have become popular methods to account for regime changes in the conditional variance dynamics of time series. The package MSGARCH allows the user to perform simulations as well as Maximum Likelihood and MCMC/Bayesian estimations of a very large class of Markov-switching GARCH-type models. The package also provides methods to make single-step and multi-step ahead forecasts of the complete conditional density of the variable of interest. Risk management tools to estimate conditional volatility, Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are also available. We illustrate the broad functionality of the MSGARCH package using exchange rate and stock market return data.</p>

                                            <p>Suppose you develop a graphical user interface which allows the user to create interactive, multi-facetted and/or multi-page charts which visualize the results of arbitrary statistical analyses. To create the charts, you query the data from a database, perform statistical computation on it, repeat it for several data chunks, and plot the results. Suppose the main performance bottleneck is the download of data. Also suppose that the user can modify the parameters of a chart several times before actually requesting the final plot. Welcome to the world of <em>radii.defer</em>, an <strong>R</strong> package by which you can create a nested chain of arbitrary (unevaluated) <strong>R</strong> functions. A <em>Defer</em> object contains a function and its arguments, and a caching scheme. The arguments of a <em>Defer</em> function may be not only standard <strong>R</strong> objects but other (usually unevaluated) <em>Defer</em> objects as well, and the arguments can be updated whenever you wish. When a <em>Defer</em> object is executed, it does not execute any of its <em>Defer</em> arguments unless it is absolutely necessary. Furthemore, <em>radii.defer</em> plays well with the <em>future</em> package allowing asynchronous execution which does not block the main <strong>R</strong> thread. In the talk we will present the main features of the package, and as an example, we will illustrate its use in a complex, cloud-based <em>Shiny</em> application which motivated the development of the package.</p>

                                            <p>The <code>recipes</code> package (Kuhn and Wickham, 2018) is a set of “Preprocessing Tools to Create Design Matrices”. It delivers a framework in which preprocessing steps on one or more variables are captured in individual objects, called <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code>. The former do transformations on variables, the latter assert that expectations about the variables are met. A <code>recipe</code> object is created on a train set, to which the <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code> are added one by one. Once the recipe is done, the <code>prep</code> method is used to estimate all the relevant statistics from the variables. Finally, the actual transformations are applied to data sets using the <code>bake</code> function on the recipe. New data, such as test sets or future observations to score, also run through the recipe via bake. This ensures that the exact same preparation is used on all data sets.</p>
                                            <p>To leverage <code>recipes</code> fully, one should add their own <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code> to the ones that are shipped with the package. However, whereas the use of the package is intuitive and quick to pick up, writing custom <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code> requires some understanding of the package inner workings. In this talk I will give a quick introduction to the package and I will elaborate on how to create your own <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code>. Providing a framework, or if you like a recipe, for them. After attending this talk you should be able to create your own steps and checks.</p>

                                            <p>Next generation sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, generate tens of millions of reads to quantify the expression levels of the features of interest. A wide number and variety of software packages have been developed for accommodating the needs of the researchers, mostly in the R/Bioconductor framework. Many of these focus on the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes (<code>DESeq2</code>, <code>edgeR</code>, ) to discover quantitative changes between experimental groups, while other address alternative splicing, discovery of novel transcripts, or RNA editing. Moreover, Exploratory Data Analysis is a common step to all these workflows, and despite its importance for generating highly reliable results, it is often neglected, as many of the steps involved might require a considerable proficiency of the user in the programming languages. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used often to obtain a dimension-reduced overview of the data.</p>
                                            <p>Our proposal addresses the two steps of Exploratory Data Analysis and Differential Expression analysis with two different Bioconductor packages, <code>pcaExplorer</code> and <code>ideal</code>. We developed web applications in the Shiny framework also including support for reproducible analyses, thanks to an embedded text editor and a template report, to seamlessly generate HTML documents as a result of the user’s exploration.</p>

                                            <p>Mixed-effect models are commonly used when data consist of clusters of observations. If the model is nonlinear in the parameters, nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models are considered. Growth or shrinkage data where the change trajectory is nonlinear is a common type of data modeled with NLME models, with the subject treated as a cluster and the repeated measurements as the individual observations nested within the cluster. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide a natural framework to describe dynamic systems but sometimes they accept closed-form solutions.</p>
                                            <p>In the recent years, a number of R packages have been created to fit NLME models using various approaches. These are the <em>nlme</em> (Pinheiro et al. 2017), <em>saemix</em> (Comets et al. 2017), <em>nlmixr</em> (Wang et al. 2017), and <em>brms</em> (Buerkner et al. 2016) packages; .each of them has its own specificities. In this talk, we compare the features (algorithms, grammar, documentation, examples), advantages (predictions, embedded model diagnostic tools), and limitations (scope, computational time, dependencies and other constraints) of these 4 solutions.</p>
                                            <p>To illustrate this analysis, we consider two examples taking from the pharmaceutical industry. The first one is a real case of pharmacokinetic data measured in a small number of subjects (N&lt;40), followed up for a long period of time with a rich sampling scheme (more than 8 assessment time points). The second one is a real case of longitudinal tumor size data measured in a large number of solid cancer patients (N&gt;100), followed up for a short period of time (with a median of 4 assessment time points).</p>

                                            <p>Wikidata, one of the most prominent Wikimedia projects nowadays, presents a formal ontology that adheres to the RDF standard. All Wikimedia projects (Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikivoyage, Wikimedia commons, etc) can reach out to and make use of Wikidata by relying on the features of MediaWiki and Wikibase. Currently, more than 800 Wikimedia websites - some of which are found among the most dynamic places online at all - maintain a client-side Wikidata usage tracking. The resulting data sets present a challenging Big Data problem that calls for SQL transfers to Hadoop via Apache Sqoop, massive HiveQL ETL operations and data wrangling in R just in order to enable for the tracking and analytics of individual Wikidata item usage statistics across the Wikimedia projects.</p>
                                            <p>The Wikidata Concepts Monitor (WDCM) system was developed in R to orchestrate various technologies (SPARQL to access Wikidata, SQL, Apache Sqoop, Hive, and Spark) in order to provide for Wikidata usage tracking and analytics. The WDCM then takes a step beyond and performs machine learning (LDA, t-SNE) across the matrices that encompass Wikidata items and Wikimedia projects in order to gain insight into the distributive semantics (i.e. topic models, dimensionality reduction for similarity maps) of Wikidata usage. The system encompasses a set of Shiny dashboards where the results of the WDCM statistical machinery are visualized and tools for analytical work provided in order to help the understanding of the utterly complex social and behavioral phenomenon of Wikidata usage.</p>

                                            <p>This talk introduces a new package, <strong>PlackettLuce</strong>, for fitting the Plackett-Luce model to rankings data. In contrast to some of the other packages or approaches to fitting the model in R, <strong>PlackettLuce</strong> can efficiently handle all of the following:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>ties in the rankings;</li>
                                                <li>rankings of only a subset items;</li>
                                                <li>clustered rankings (rankings for distinct sets of items), and</li>
                                                <li>one or more items that are always ranked first or last in their rankings.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p><strong>PlackettLuce</strong> also enables inference on the worth estimates by providing model-based standard errors and a method for obtaining quasi-standard errors, which don't depend on the identifiability constraints.</p>
                                            <p>Another key feature of the package is a method for fitting Plackett-Luce trees, which will be illustrated in a novel application to identify growing conditions for which trial varieties of bean plants have significantly different worth values.</p>

                                            <p>All R users have used S3, the oldest and most prominent object-oriented system in R even if they were unaware of it, for example by using the summary function both for data frames and for linear models. The two main building blocks of an object-oriented system are objects with specific type (class) and functions (methods) which behave differently depending on the class of their parameters. Most R users probably also had an experience where they got unexpected results which would have been easier to understand with a foundation in object-oriented systems in R. This talk aims to fill some of the gaps so that you can work confidently with existing code utilizing S3 or S4.</p>
                                            <p>The three widely used object-oriented systems are S3, S4 and R6. This talk will focus on S3 which is the most widely used and assume no prior knowledge of object-oriented systems. I will start with a visual explanation of the most important concepts and then I will show you how understanding the basics can help you in your day-to-day work. I will guide you with examples and show hands-on tricks to understand, debug and get the documentation of existing code utilizing S3 or S4.</p>

                                            <p>Cryptocurrencies have recently gained a lot of interest from investors, central banks and governments worldwide. The lack of any form of political regulation and their market far from being “efficient”, requires new forms of regulation in the near future. In this paper we study the predictability of cryptocurrencies time–series. We perform a Dynamic Model Averaging analysis using many predictors leading us to more than 31 millions of Dynamic Linear Models estimated at each point in time during the forecast horizon. The whole analysis and the associated huge computational complexity relies on the eDMA package of Catania and Nonejad [2017, Journal Statistical Software, (in press)] available in the R environment. Results are reported for the four most representative coins and indicate different levels of predictability depending on: i) the time period, ii) forecast horizon, iii) and type of coin. A Portfolio optimization application shows that trading strategies which incorporate cryptocurrencies are profitable even after the inclusion of transaction costs.</p>

                                            <p>Subscriptions are no longer just for newspapers. The consumer product landscape, particularly among e-commerce firms, includes a bevy of subscription-based business models. Internet and mobile phone subscriptions are now commonplace and joining the ranks are dietary supplements, meals, clothing, cosmetics and personal grooming products.</p>
                                            <p>Standard metrics to diagnose a healthy consumer-brand relationship typically include customer purchase frequency and ultimately, retention of the customer demonstrated by regular purchases. If a brand notices that a customer isn’t purchasing, it may consider targeting the customer with discount offers or deploying a tailored messaging campaign in the hope that the customer will return and not “churn”.</p>
                                            <p>The churn diagnosis, however, becomes more complicated for subscription-based products, many of which offer multiple delivery frequencies and the ability to pause a subscription. Brands with subscription-based products need to have some reliable measure of churn propensity so they can further isolate the factors that lead to churn and preemptively identify at-risk customers.</p>
                                            <p>During the presentation I’ll show how to analyze churn propensity for products with multiple states, such as different subscription cadences or a paused subscription.

                                            <p>Shiny is a popular web application framework that allows to quickly build analytical dashboards using only R. It has many great built-in features that address the needs of most of users. But, what if you need to go beyond that and build custom solutions packed with features that are not available straight away? How far can you push Shiny without breaking it?</p>

                                            <p>It turns out that quite far. In the Exploratory Data Science team at Pearson, we use Shiny to create self-serve analytical tools for internal clients. While we create these tools based on initial requirements, we often need to be able to add additional features as the tool matures. This forces us to think outside the box about how we can build upon the framework offered by Shiny.</p>

                                            <p>In this talk, we’ll present our most complex Shiny app yet. We’ll talk about the process we went through while building it, from prototyping through development, user testing, and deployment. We will cover advanced features of Shiny (e.g. a modularised application structure), communication between Shiny server and JavaScript, as well as sophisticated UI solutions (e.g. click drilldowns, interactive tutorials and custom welcome screens). Most importantly, we will cover what we have learned through rounds of usability testing that entirely changed our approach to data application design.</p>

                                            <p>Statistical data analysis on stream networks needs to take into account the spatial correlation of measurements sampled at connected stream sites. The <em>SSN</em> package for Spatial Statistical Modeling on Stream Networks provides tools to fit glms with spatial autocorrelation. However, so far the tool ‘STARS’ provided for GIS data preparation is based on the commercial software ArcGIS. <em>openSTARS</em> offers an alternative in <strong>R</strong> based on open source GRASS GIS and R packages for spatial data. Thereby it merges the whole work flow of data preparation and statistical analysis on stream networks in one software. <em>openSTARS</em> provides functions to derive stream networks from a digital elevation model, detect and correct non-dichotomous junctions, which cannot be handled by <em>SSN</em>, derive stream catchments and intersect them with land use or other GIS data as potential explanatory variables. Additionally, locations for model predictions can be generated along the stream network. We exemplify the application of <em>openSTARS</em> for water quality monitoring data.</p>

                                            <p>When designing products and taking data-informed decisions, the stories of individuals are often obscured by the tendency to focus solely on aggregated data and models. This talk will focus on the paradigm I embrace, and the tools I build on top of the tidyverse packages, to combat this tendency.</p>

                                            <p>At WUZZUF, we provide online career services including job boards, applicant tracking systems, and assessments. I’ll talk about a situation where we observed a low supply of talent for senior software developers jobs, outlining my approach to testing hypotheses about the root causes of the supply/demand imbalance. Rather than reacting to the problem by looking at high-level metrics and jumping to conclusions about the root causes <em>(seen as an acquisition issue by marketers or a recommendation issue by engineers)</em>, I started a deeper analysis, oriented by job hunting and hiring as human experiences.</p>

                                            <p>The tidyverse tools enabled me to see the stories of individuals while maintaining context through the patterns of groups. I’ll highlight how combining <code>tidyr</code>, <code>purrr</code>, list columns, and 'shiny' let me go beyond the preliminary assumptions and reveal deeper issues. At the end, this led to actionable insights regarding our search/recommendation, talent acquisition and job postings.</p>

                                            <p>Although it has academic origins, R is now widely used for many real-world applications including finance, epidemiology, store location analysis and conservation. Indications suggest that the language continues to gain adoption in other areas due to its advantages of cost, reproducibility and flexibility over proprietary products. This talk will explore the potential uptake of R for transport planning, a domain in which powerful yet accessible scriptable languages have much to offer. Transport planning relies on data analysis, a range of spatial and temporal data forms, and visualisation, areas that R excels in, especially with add-on packages such as <strong>sf</strong>. To illustrate the point the talk will describe work commissioned by the UK's Department for Transport to develop a Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT). The PCT is now being used around England to help design strategic cycle networks and improve the effectiveness of precious public investment in transport infrastructure (Lovelace et al. 2017). Based on the experience developing the PCT we will discuss the limitations of R as a tool for transport planning, and the potential of recent developments in packages such as <strong>stplanr</strong> and <strong>dodgr</strong> packages to address them (Lovelace and Ellison, under review). The talk will conclude by outlining reasons for transport planning authorities to demand the use of open source software and reproducibility to ensure democratic accountability and the cost-effective use of public funds.</p>

                                            <p>Current datasets often contain many variables. To cope with this, sparse regression methods have been developed to obtain more interpretable and better performing models than their classical counterparts. Standard regularization methods such as the Lasso or Elastic Net are already implemented in <em>R</em> to obtain sparse GLM results. However, variables often have different structural properties demanding different regularization techniques to obtain logical results. We propose a multi-type Lasso approach to solve this problem, where coefficients of different variables can be regularized by different penalties. Our proposed estimation procedure uses the theory of proximal to split the objective function into smaller subproblems. Each of these subproblems will only contain one penalty such that existing algorithms can be applied. We show how this setup is implemented in <em>R</em> and how different tools and packages work together to get the most out of our approach. The setup is being implemented in an <em>R</em> package where bottleneck calculations happen in <em>C++</em> through the <em>Rcpp</em> API.</p>

                                            <p>A newly emerging field in statistics is distributional regression, where not only the mean but each parameter of a response distribution can be modeled using a set of predictors (Klein et al., 2015). Notable frameworks called Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape and Bayesian Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape were introduced by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2001) in the form of a frequentist perspective and Umlauf, Klein, and Zeileis (2017) using a Bayesian approach, respectively. In distributional regression models, the interpretation of covariate effects on response moments and the expected conditional response distribution is more difficult than with traditional methods such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Generalized Linear Models (GLM) since the moments of a distribution often do not directly equate the modeled parameters but are rather a combination of them with a varying degree of complexity. This talk will introduce a framework for the visualization of distributional regression models fitted using the bamlss R package (Umlauf et al., 2017) as well as feature an implementation as an R extension titled bamlss.vis. The main goals of this framework are the abilities to: 1. See and compare the expected distribution for chosen sets of covariates 2. View the direct relationship between moments of the response distribution and a chosen explanatory variable, given a set of covariates. Additionally, the user can obtain the code which created the visualizations described above to potentially reproduce them later.</p>

                                            <p>The area-characteristic, maximum possible earthquake magnitude is required by the earthquake engineering community, disaster management agencies and the insurance industry. The Gutenberg-Richter law predicts that earthquake magnitudes follow a truncated exponential distribution. In the geophysical literature several parametric and non-parametric estimation procedures were proposed. Estimation of the maximum possible earthquake magnitude is of course an extreme value problem to which classical methods for endpoint estimation could be applied. However, recent extreme value theory (EVT) methods for truncated tails at high levels constitute a more appropriate setting for this estimation problem. In this talk, we use the methods from the extreme value and geophysical literature to estimate the maximum possible magnitude of earthquakes induced by gas extraction in the Groningen province of the Netherlands. Moreover, a <strong>Shiny</strong> application has been developed (https://treynkens.shinyapps.io/Groningen_app/) to let users perform the analysis where they can e.g. change the considered time period.</p>
                                            <p>All considered EVT-based endpoint estimators are implemented in the <strong>ReIns</strong> package which complements the book &quot;Reinsurance: actuarial and statistical aspects&quot;. In addition to EVT tools to deal with truncated data, <strong>ReIns</strong> provides implementations of classical EVT plots and estimators, and EVT methods that handle censored data.</p>

                                            <p>We describe a framework to use Random Forest to generate spatial and spatiotemporal predictions i.e. as an alternative to model-based geostatistics. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is sub-optimal. To account for this, we use Random Forest (as implemented in the ranger package) in combination with geographical distances to sampling locations to fit models and predict values. We describe eight typical situations of interest to spatial prediction applications: (1) prediction of 2D continuous variable without any covariates, (2) prediction of 2D variable with covariates, (3) prediction of binomial variable, (4) prediction of categorical variable, (5) prediction of variables with extreme values, (6) weighted regression, (7) predictions of multivariate problems, and (8) prediction of spatiotemporal variable. Our results indicate that RFsp can produce comparable results to model-based geostatistics. The advantage of RFsp over model-based geostatistics is that RFsp requires much less statistical assumptions and is easier to automate (and scale up through parallelization). On the other hand, computational intensity of RFsp can blow up as the number of training points and covariates increases. RFsp is still an experimental method and application with large data sets (&gt;&gt;200 spatial locations) is probably not recommended.

                                            <p>Apply family functions are one of the R language advantages. They not only make the code look cleaner and more understandable, but oftentimes decrease the time of the code execution. Conducting calculations for my PhD I struggled with the need of operating on both columns and rows of the dataset. Double for loops with embedded custom functions to execute in each iteration were unclear, slow and caused errors. Efficient alternative may be utilizing nested apply family functions. I will show some of examples, that turned out to be very useful in my work. Combining apply and sapply together helped me decrease execution time thrice when compared to double for loop. One smart line of tapply nested in apply substituted four lines of aggregate function looped with for - with the same output. In most cases I first used apply to access the single column, and then - depending on the task - sapply or tapply, to perform given operation on the rows of the given column. In some cases I also implemented indexing rows in sapply, to operate only on selected rows of the columns. Additional advantage of this approach is no need to create a storage object (e.g. a data frame) before, as apply function accommodates and does not demand predefined type and dimension of the data structure.</p>

                                            <p>The considered problem was to estimate multi-annual averages of climatic parameters (air temperature, precipitation etc.) using an ensemble of the climate models.

A simple approach was developed to counteract discovered pitfalls and to utilize the data of the coarse temporal resolution while remaining on the safe side.</p>

                                            <p>One of the main strengths of R are the many different add-on packages, covering various areas in statistics and machine learning as well as data wrangling and visualisation, interacting with APIs, etc. Over 12'000 packages are available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and thousands more through BioConductor and GitHub. While it is great to have so many options, such a wealth of packages is not always easy to navigate, especially for someone new to the R ecosystem. How do you find a package for your task at hand? If there are several candidates, how do you choose which one to use? A typical workflow is to first gather a set of packages with relevant functionality before, via high-level comparisons, narrowing that set down to a handful of packages which are then explored in more detail. This talks highlights different approaches to discovering, comparing and choosing packages and the tools available for this: curated lists such as the CRAN task views, search-focussed approaches such as RSeek, community-driven approaches like Crantastic!, R-bloggers and R-weekly, metrics for high-level comparisons and suggested guidelines for in-depth review.</p>

                                            <p>Main topic of this talk is simple - it is desired to tell whether a selected player performs well or at least well enough.</p>
                                            <p>The process of the analysis is quite complex and demands several more or less complicated algorithms. First we introduce an algorithm for data pre-processing.</p>
                                            <p>Data is obtained using <strong>nhlscrapr</strong> package which extracts data from NHL's <em>Real Time Scoring System</em>. <em>RTSS</em> contains informations about every single event that has occurred on ice in a selected season. This data is then processed using Macdoland's linear regression model. The result is a special <em>+/-</em> statistic which is adjusted to a single player's performace, thus we call it <em>adjusted plus-minus (APM)</em>.</p>
                                            <p>However, there are several hundreds of players in NHL and it is not really possible to examine every single player. For this reason a logistic regression model, which aggregates player performances, was created and tells us, which team is supposed to be well performing. Finally, our estimates are compared with real results.</p>
                                            <p>This approach is quite unique as the aggregation serves as method of backtesting.</p>
                                            <p>This leads us to a question - <em>can a player's performance be analysed?</em></p>

                                            <p>There is an urgent need for regional indicators, especially on poverty and social exclusion, by policy makers in the EU. Surveys which were designed to estimate these indicators on national level, such as EU-SILC, usually do not provide the required precision for reliable estimates on regional levels like NUTS2 and below.</p>
                                            <p>With the R-Package <strong>surveysd</strong>, we present a package for estimating standard errors for yearly surveys with and without rotating panel design. Using surveys with complex survey designs e.g. multistage sampling design is supported and can be freely defined. The implemented method for standard error estimation uses bootstrapping techniques in combination with multiple consecutive waves of the survey. This leads to a reduction in the standard error, especially for estimates done on a subgroup of the survey data. The package enables the user to estimate point estimates as well as their standard error on arbitrary subgroups of his/her data. Also the applied point estimate can freely be chosen, although some predefined point estimates are already implemented. Finally the results can be visualized in two different ways to gain quick insight in the quality of the estimated results.</p>

                                            <p>Item Response Theory (IRT) is a fundamental concept used in analysing educational data. IRT modelling is used for estimating the difficulty of quiz questions, and the skill levels of learners. However, it can also be applied to the variety of other areas, e.g. clinical trials [1] or influence of genes on some medical conditions [2].</p>
                                            <p>The simplest way to implement IRT modelling in your R workflow is to use one of the dedicated R packages. However, this is also the least elastic approach because these packages either do not allow to introduce any additional variables, or allow it only to a limited degree.</p>
                                            <p>A more flexible way of customising an IRT-based model is to treat it as logistic regression with random effects. When more complex models need to be fit, one may need to use Bayesian modelling software such as Stan, or estimate model parameters with gradient descent using libraries such as TensorFlow.</p>
                                            <p>In this talk, I’ll show how to estimate IRT model parameters in R using each of these approaches. I’ll also highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Most of the approaches that I’ll show may also be applied to other areas, not only IRT.</p>

                                            <p>Current studies conclude that human facial attractiveness perception is data-based and irrespective of the perceiver. However, the analyses of associations between facial geometry and its visual impact exceed the power of classical statistical methods. What is more, current plastic surgery deals with aesthetic indications such as an improvement of the attractiveness of a smile or other facial emotions.</p>
                                            <p>In this work, we have applied machine-learning methods and R language to explore how accurate classification of photographed faces into sets of facial emotions (based on Ekman-Friesen FACS scale) is, and, furthermore, which facial emotions are associated with higher level of facial attractiveness, measured using Likert scale by a board of observers. Facial image data were collected for each of a patient (exposed to an emotion incentive), then processed, landmarked and analysed using R. Bayesian naive classifiers using <code>e1071</code> package, regression trees via <code>tree</code> and <code>rpart</code> packages and finally neural networks by <code>neuralnet</code> package were learned to allow assigning a new face image data into one of the facial emotions.</p>
                                            <p>Neural networks manifested the highest predictive accuracy of a new face categorization into facial emotions. The geometrical shape of a mouth, then eyebrows and finally eyes affect in descending order an intensity of a classified emotion, as was identified using decision trees.</p>
                                            <p>We performed machine-learning analyses using R to compare which classification method conducts the best prediction accuracy when classifying face images into facial emotions, and to point out which facial emotions and their geometry affect facial attractiveness the most, and therefore should preferentially be addressed within plastic surgeries.</p>

                                            <p>Many fields of science are slow to adopt open scientific practices (e.g. sharing code), especially in the biomedical fields. Given the increasing calls and demands for science to be more open (open data, open source) and reproducible, these practices will increasingly become requirements to publish papers and obtain funding. However, one of the biggest challenges for many researchers is that it is difficult to adhere to open and reproducible science principles. While there are a few packages and workflows currently available, e.g. <a href="http://projecttemplate.net/"><code>ProjectTemplate</code></a> or <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=makeProject"><code>makeProject</code></a>, these packages tend to focus on template creation or rely on extensive documentation rather than automation. The <a href="https://github.com/lwjohnst86/prodigenr"><code>prodigenr</code></a> package aims to simplify and automate many of these open science tasks. Presently, the <code>prodigenr</code> package automates the creation of an open reproducible research project, with templates for manuscripts, posters, and slides currently available. The structure and workflow of the newly created project emphasizes adhering to reproducible practices (e.g. documenting dependencies, use of R Markdown for manuscripts with R code chunks, etc). The ultimate goal is to create a package (or packages) similar in ideology to the <code>devtools</code> package, but aimed at mainly biomedical researchers and scientists using (or wanting to use) open scientific practices. This package is also being developed through the Mozilla <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y8632w22">Open Project Leader Training</a>. The aim is to create an ecosystem of packages that encourage and automate open science principles. The aim of presenting this package and ideas at eRum is to get feedback and suggestions from the community (particularly surrounding practices in reproducibility and open science), how to best target biomedical researchers, and to find potential collaborators.</p>

                                            <p>The set cover problem is of fundamental importance in the field of approximation algorithms: Given a collection of sets, find the smallest sub-collection, so that all elements from a universe are covered. A diverse range of real world problems can be represented as set cover instance such as location-allocation, shift planning or virus detection. An optimal solution to the problem via linear programming is available. Due to the computational costs involved, this is not a feasible solution for large problems. A quick approximation is given by the greedy algorithm.</p>
                                            <p>This talk introduces RcppGreeySetCover, an implementation of the greedy set cover algorithm using Rcpp. The implementation is fast due to the reliance on efficient data structures made available by the Boost headers and the C++ 11 standard library. Preprocessing of input data is done efficiently via the data.table package. Input and output data is a tidy two column data.frame.<br />
                                                As a case study, we apply the package on a large scale (&gt;= 100 million rows) hospital placement problem, which initially motivated the creation of the package.</p>

Realising that learners understand the material you teach is priceless and highly motivating. Especially when running training or workshops on complex material, like R.</p>

                                            <p>In our data and analytics company, we have been writing R packages for clients (and ourselves) for several years. Virtually all of our projects include an R package. In some projects, package development is the main goal, whereas in others the package only supports a statistical analysis and may never be used again.</p>
                                            <p>Even in the latter case, we would always write a package because it reduces the number of errors and eases the communication in a team. Writing packages is not difficult, but there is always a way to do it even better. In this talk I want to share some of our lessons learned which have evolved into a company-wide set of best practices.</p>
                                            <p>The most important learning is that tests and checks are as important for a data analysis as they are for software development. Helpful tools and strategies are also to rely on R CMD check, writing tests using the testthat package, and testing a package under different operating systems. To facilitate the work in a team, a version control system is essential as well as a common style guide.</p>

These sources can be smart meters, meteorological stations, web traffic etc. Large datasets of time series have to be processed in a fast way and mined for important and accurate decision making. Time series representation methods help more effective time series data mining thanks to their useful features as significant dimensionality reduction, the emphasis of fundamental (essential) shape characteristics and implicit noise handling. In the talk, various time series representation methods will be presented. Their implementations and usage by TSrepr package will be shown. The use case with smart meter data clustering will be shown in order to demonstrate the usefulness of various representation methods for a consumers profile extraction and improvement of consumption forecasting accuracy. The simple extensibility of the TSrepr functionality will be also shown.</p>

                                            <p>This lightning talk’s aim is to provide a hands-on introduction to optimized textual sentiment indexation in R using the ‘sentometrics’ package. Driven by data availability, sentiment analysis is increasingly used to capture the information value within textual data of all sorts. We set forward a methodology that accounts for the metadata of texts and the various degrees of freedom in aggregating sentiment to construct plenty textual sentiment time series. Such time series, or indices, can then be related to other variables given appropriate econometric techniques. We propose to use the elastic net regression as a way to deal with the many (correlated) sentiment indices. Above workflow is fully implemented in the R package ‘sentometrics’. The package allows to compute lexicon-based sentiment scores of numerous texts at once, to aggregate the textual sentiment scores into multiple time series, and use these time series to predict any other variable. The talk will consist in a fast-paced but clear example of how to use the R package, from which the methodology becomes evident at the same time. For the example, we take a corpus of texts from two major U.S. journals to obtain daily forecasts of a monthly index of economic policy uncertainty.</p>

                                            <p>According to the hierarchy of scientific evidence, a meta-analysis - when executed properly - can provide the most reliable answer for a research question. However, conducting a meta-analysis is a time consuming enterprise, that requires not just domain specific knowledge and analytical experience, but considerable data management skills as well. To aid reproducible research, it should be possible to handle all data management tasks directly from R. Although there are excellent R packages to for conducting the statistical part of a meta-analysis - like the famous {metafor} package -, there is a lack of packages dedicated to meta-analysis data management. We present the {metamanager} package, that was developed to efficiently manage meta-analysis projects using R. Using the package helps to implement the requirements of the PRISMA checklist, and provides convenient functions for conducting reproducible meta-analysis. Key functionality involves refining search terms, conducting literature search in multiple scientific databases, downloading and tidying article meta-data, creating files for screening and coding articles, calculating coder agreement, etc. The functions can be easily arranged into human readable pipelines using the %&gt;% operator. The package uses google drive to store data, which ensures continuous access and provides a straightforward interface for manual data entry, while handles version control and collaborative editing. It is also convenient for research teams where not all collaborators are proficient in R. During the presentation I am going to show the functionality of the package through a real-life example.</p>

                                            <p>Setting up the computer environment for all participants of an R workshop can be a daunting and exasperating task. Installing and setting up the softwares and obtaining necessary files could give a confusing tone right at the beginning of the workshop before you have even started with the programme delivery. Not messing up with setup and being able to start using R in the same fashion as other people in the group is desirable not just to the workshop participants, but to the instructor.</p>
                                            <p>There are a few options available for setting up RStudio in a browser. Using RStudio Server enables you to setup working environment tailored to your specific audience. It helps by removing any frustrations for the participants caused by downloads of the required files and installations from other workshop activities that you really want them to focus on. Setting up RStudio Server on Amazon Web Service (ASW), called an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance, is not difficult. You can customise the working environment to meet your needs by installing globally required packages, adding the data and the script files you want participants to have available when running RStudio in their browsers. Another alternative that has become recently available is RStudio Cloud. Although RStudio Cloud is an alpha version and it is still under development you could already do pretty much everything you are able by setting up your own RStudio Server.</p>
                                            <p>This talk will illustrate the possibilities and benefits of using RStudio in a browser that could provide a great environment for teaching and learning data science with R.</p>

                                            <p>The national quality measurement and improvement system in Germany is based on about 350 indicators, evaluated yearly or quarterly in order to improve selected areas of healthcare quality.

One of the largest <em>R</em> components currently in routine use is an internal package that computes the results of the indicators for around 1,500 hospitals throughout Germany in more than 20 medical areas, including obstetrics, transplantation medicine, hip and knee replacement. The package was developed to validate the results published by the institute and is subsequently used for primary computation.</p>
                                            <p>Internal packages are developed using an automated build infrastructure, automated tests and code reviews.

                                            <p>Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models capture the variability of the target population of patients and enable the search for potential covariance influence on drug's PK/PD parameters in individuals. This knowledge could help to adjust drug dosing in clinical practice. However, the complexity of the models, their underlying hiercharchy and the variety of softwares used for analysis make population models incomprehensible for clinicians, while they could be valuable for individualizing therapy and increasing its safety. Doctors need an easy tool which will be able to answer typical questions emerging in clinical setting. Shiny package offers a readily-available solution to this issue that does not require any programming skills nor pharmacometric expertise. In this talk the use of Shiny application representing pharmacometric model will be discussed in practice.</p>

                                            <p>Have you ever tried to find a hotel that is close to the conference venue but then you realized that close in terms of a distance doesn’t always mean the same in terms of time? Or have you searched the house market for a place that is the closest to both yours and your partner's workplaces? Simple distance measures could not be the best in these cases. For example, you are unable to cross a river in every point - you need to find the closest bridge. Additionally, transportation availability varies for different places and largely depends on a preferred mode of transportation (e.g. foot, cycle, motor vehicle, public transport). Private motor vehicle could be the most efficient in the suburbs, but not the most suitable in a city center. Distance Matrix API of Google Maps accessed through the googleway and spatial packages can be useful to answer the above questions. It allows for computation of distances and times between points, but also can be modified to create isochrone maps. They present areas of the similar “distance” minutes spend traveling (or kilometers along roads) from the point of interested. In this talk, we will show a case study of finding the most optimal place to stay for the eRum conference by the means of interactive visualization features of spatial R for location optimization.</p>

With this in mind, the VSSB Advanced Analytics team wanted to create a solution that is easy to use, dynamic and is very much centered around needs of the business. The concept has been brought into life on a dataset containing real information about how people were using the cars of the company’s fleet. The mapping is conducted with the help of the leaflet package and the solution is embedded into a Shiny environment.</p>

                                            <p>The Swiss social security system, one of the most robust, is based on a three-pillar regime. The first Pillar, common to most developed countries, is a state-run pay-as-you-earn system with minimum benefits. The voluntary contribution (Pillar III) is a privately-run, tax-deductible insurance fund. At the heart of the Swiss system is the so-called Pillar II, a compulsory, tax-deductible company occupational pension insurance fund. Voluntary Pillar II buy-ins are regulated but allow for benefits improvement while reducing the tax burden during the working career. The complexity is further increased by a municipality-dependent taxation. Altogether this calls for an early-stage conscious approach towards retirement planning. However, it is not straight-forward to assess effects of early retirement, moving to a different canton or applying a different voluntary pension schema.</p>
                                            <p>SmaRP, Smart Retirement Planning, supports the users in an educated decision-making. Using R and Shiny, we developed a parameterisable pension calculator web application, which provides real-time computation of the total retirement funds over time, explicitly accounting for the various contributing blocks. It features a flexible yet intuitive user interface with several options for detailed personalisation. An interactive visualisation is implemented using googleVis and the underlying data is made available for download. The user is additionally presented with a custom report generated with rmarkdown/knitr. Unlike other pension calculators, the details of the model approach and underlying assumptions are disclosed to make results transparent and reproducible. The modular structure of the Shiny application allows for seamless extension and supports modular execution, making the application fully adaptive.</p>
                                            <p>In this talk we will give a deep-dive into the framework by showcasing illustrative ex- amples and scenarios everyone can relate to.</p>

                                            <p>Users of such web data products should be able to immediately access the feedback relevant to their answers. To increase the value of the feedback, it should be dynamically customised to each respondent. This can be achieved by pre-programmed templates of feedback scenarios, which can be adaptively customised by the respondent’s answers to this or previous questions. Employing large analytical and data visualisation capabilities in R, we could try to adapt any type of instant feedback to each user. Using R, we could also combine different feedback sources: a respondent’s answers to a given question and to other questions, other users’ answers, external open data (imported into our app or available via APIs), and aggregated or summarised outcomes from reference studies.</p>

                                            <p>Since 1974, the Statistical Office has privileged access to detailed information on the Zurich real estate market in form of administrative data. Despite a wide range of statistics, simple inquiry tools and in-depth analyses, the Statistical Office is receiving more and more complex queries on the real estate market. Many of these requests are similar and can be met using standard processes. Nevertheless, they cause a (too) high personnel expenditure in production, quality assurance and communication.</p>
                                            <p>To solve this problem, the office is currently developing an R-Shiny application, which allows to create complex analyses from different areas of the real estate market without any specific programming knowledge. Spatial, temporal and content criteria can be individually selected using various selection tools. In a real-time calculation, the <strong>Zurich RealEstateApp</strong> produces the results and displays them in tabular and graphical form. A download function for the tables and graphics is also provided (Excel, csv, pdf). The application ensures that the results are methodically and content wise clean and harmless in terms of data protection law, making it easy and reliable for customers to access valuable facts for their decision-making process.</p>
                                            <p>The described project will be presented at the erum2018 conference in the form of a presentation. In addition to the most important steps during the development and the central selection tools of the app, application examples and initial findings from the test phase with beta users will be presented. It is planned that interested parties will be able to test the app themselves during the conference.</p>

                                            <p>The possibility of differentiating between types of atmospheric precipitation is of a key importance in contemporary climatological studies. Both liquid and solid precipitation, being one of the elements of the water circulation, may be viewed as extreme weather phenomena that are possibly dangerous, and therefore they play an important role for the economy. Present knowledge of physical dependencies conditioning the occurrence of surface precipitation type is burdened with a considerable error. Therefore numerous studies try to parametrize atmospheric factors that impacts this phenomena.</p>
                                            <p>In this study authors aimed to use different data sources such as: dual-polarimetric doppler radars, satellite-derived products, lightning detection network, mesoscale numerical weather prediction model and in-situ observations. Due to different: (1) data reliability, (2) notable differences in temporal and (3) spatial resolution, and also (4) different data formats (HDF-5, NetCDF, GRIB, GeoTIFF, ASCII), a common database was created. Some limitation of R for raster dataset was found for rotated geographical projections. The application of machine learning algorithms, especially based on the ‘caret’ (to avoid overfitting) and ‘Boruta’ packages, let to find all relevant features that might be applicable for modelling of surface precipitation type.</p>

                                            <p>Virtually all malignant tumours carry somatic mutations. Distinct mutational processes tumour have been exposed imprint specific structural alteration in the DNA. Recent studies have reported there are at least 30 signatures associated to underlying mutational processes in cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease based on molecular profile (transcriptome). However, it is not clear whether mutational processes each tumour have been exposed can differentiate then in terms of biological behaviour. We used the <em>SomaticSignatures</em> and <em>deconstructSigs</em> packages in <strong>R</strong> over WES data to infer mutational signatures associated to breast carcinomas from TCGA database and used an unsupervised hierarchical clustering to identify samples exposed to similar mutational processes. We identified 8 operative mutational processes (S1 - S8) across 1,068 breast cancer samples. S1, S2, S3 and S8 are highly correlated to COSMIC signatures 2/13 (APOBEC activity), 1 , 3 and 5, respectively. We applied hierarchical clustering to the mutational spectrum matrix by samples. Most samples (356) clusters at C4. The C4 signature is enriched by S3 (COSMIC 1) signature, associate to age related endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Luminal A and B tumours preferentially cluster at C4. On the other hand, Basal-like and HER2 tumours cluster preferentially at C7 and C2, respectively. The C7 is enriched for S7 signature (strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations). The C2 is enriched for S1 signature (activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases). This is the first report demonstrating specific breast cancer subtypes are exposed to distinct mutational processes.</p>

                                            <p>Eco-hydrological models are increasingly used in the contexts of hydrology, ecology, precision agriculture for a detailed description of the water cycle at various scales: local scale, an hillslope or a watershed. However, with increasing computing power and observations available, bigger and bigger amount of raw data are produced. Therefore the need to develop flexible and user-oriented interfaces to visualize multiple outputs, perform sensitivity analyzes and compare against observations emerges. This work presents two R open-source packages: <strong>geotopbricks</strong> and <strong>geotopOptim2</strong>. They offer an I/0 interface and R visualization tools the GEOtop hydrological distributed model (http://geotopmodel.github.io/geotop/), which solves water mass and energy budget equations to describe water cycle in the Earth´s critical zone. The package <em>geotopbricks</em> (https://github.com/ecor/geotopbricks and https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geotopbricks ) is able to to read the GEOtop I/O data of the model. The package <em>geotopOptim2</em> (https://github.com/EURAC-Ecohydro/geotopOptim2) calling the <strong>hydroPSO</strong> (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroPSO) package can be used for model calibration against observations. Further details and complete R package dependencies are listed in <em>geotopOtim2</em> description file.</p>

We will apply text mining methods, in particular focusing on using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. This approach will allow us to predict unknown categories of offers basing on extracted keywords. We will use tidytext, topicmodels and tm packages. Last but not least, we will use dimension reduction techniques implemented in homals package to prepare informative visualization. This poster is a part of our master’s thesis devoted to usage of Internet data sources to provide job vacancy statistics. R packages: tidytext, tm, homals, topicmodels.</p>

                                            <p>Dynamic Time Warping (<strong>DTW</strong>, [Sakoe et al. 1978]) is a distance measure for two time series of different lengths that allows non-linear alignments of time series and has been applied in many fields (text mining, activity recognition, transport research, etc.) for detection of motifs, classification and clustering. In contrast to the Euclidean distance, the complexity of DTW computation is quadratic in the number of time points. There are many approaches on speeding up the calculation of DTW (early abandoning, approximation, lower bound). Many applications generate streaming data, e.g. transport mode detection. For streaming data, an efficient incremental computation of DTW is desirable, which our R package <strong>IncDTW</strong> (Incremental Dynamic Time Warping) facilitates by recycling already computed results. We used the Rcpp package to implement the heart of the DTW algorithm in C++. We collected smartphone accelerometer data while travelling with different transport modes and demonstrate that DTW outperforms the traditional Euclidean distance in detecting transport mode specific patterns, and how the computation time benefits from the incremental calculations. In terms of computation time we compare our implementation with existing ones in R and demonstrate our method to be up to 20 times faster.</p>

The study area is situated in the northern part of Poznań in Warta river valley. View point is located on the roof of the building of the Faculty of Geographical and Geological Sciences of Adam Mickiewicz University. During the study, 28 persons (14 women and 14 men) was qualified for the project. Using the mobile eyetracker which recorder eyeball movement for assessing the AOI (area of interest) they perceived the same section of a panorama in various seasons and under different types of weather. 9 research cycles throughout the entire research period (January 2017 – February 2018) were conducted to take into consideration the seasonal changes in the landscape. As a result, we expect to determine variables concerning the magnitude and nature of changes in perception taking into consideration the degree of influence of the current weather state. As the research has demonstrated responders with negative feelings spent four times more average with eye gaze on development area, trees in flower and almost three times more on buildings. These ones who average spend two times more dwell time on sand, felled-tree and flowers said that landscape was non-stimulating. In the study, calculations and visualization were made using R program packages.</p>

                                            <p>According to current studies, facial attractiveness perception seems to be data-driven and irrespective of the perceiver. However, the ways how to evaluate facial attractiveness complexly and how to make comparisons between facial images of patients before and after plastic surgery procedure are still unclear and require ongoing research.</p>
                                            <p>In this study, we have developed a web-based shiny application providing facial image processing, i. e. manual face landmarking, facial geometry computations and regression model fitting allowing to identify geometric facial features associated with an increase of facial attractiveness after undergoing rhinoplasty, one of the most common plastic surgeries.</p>
                                            <p>Profile facial image data were collected for each of a patient, processed, landmarked and analysed using the web-based application. Multivariate linear regression was performed to select predictors increasing facial attractiveness after undergoing rhinoplasty. Facial attractiveness was measured using Likert scale by a board of independent observers.</p>
                                            <p>The shiny web framework enables to develop a complex web interface and, because of <code>shinyjs</code> package, a clickable interaction useful for the landmarking as well. Given the collected data, enlargement both of a nasolabial and nasofrontal angle within rhinoplasty were determined as significant predictors increasing facial attractiveness.</p>
                                            <p>We built a web-based shiny application enabling basic facial image processing and evaluating facial attractiveness. Furthermore, we performed a regression analysis using the application to point out which facial geometric features affect facial attractiveness the most, and therefore should preferentially be treated within plastic surgeries.</p>

Patient noncompliance can take many different forms and can be measured in a number of ways. In our presentation we chose the disease-free survival as measurement of treatment effectiveness.</p>
                                            <p>We focus on the problem that patient compliance should be calculated from data collected during the whole investigated interval till the event time.

                                            <p>We present two possible solutions. First, we investigate the method generally known for time-dependent covariates where final results are determined as a weighted average of several survival models applied on shorter sub-periods of the original time period. Second, we present our model where the investigated period is divided into two parts: first we determine the compliance from data of the first period and then apply the survival model only for the second period. We perform a series of the above survival models changing the cut-point and investigate the effect of the choice of cut-point on the results.</p>

                                            <p>Multi-state models are a useful way of describing a process in which an individual moves through a number of finite states in continuous time. The illness-death model plays a central role in the theory and practice of these models, describing the dynamics of healthy subjects who may move to an intermediate “diseased” state before entering into a terminal absorbing state. In these models one important goal is the modeling of transition rates which is usually done by studying the relationship between covariates and disease evolution. However, biomedical researchers are also interested in reporting other interpretable results in a simple and summarized manner. These include estimates of predictive probabilities, such as the transition probabilities, occupation probabilities, cumulative incidence functions, prevalence and the sojourn time distributions. An R package was built providing answers to all these topics.</p>

                                            <p>In the Caspian Sea, a renowned endemic rich ecosystem, species likely diversified in space along various abiotic parameters such as temperature, salinity and depth. In a previous study, these parameters were used to infer 10 ecoregions, which are nested into three physico-geographically defined sea areas: i) North Caspian ii) Middle Caspian, and iii) South Caspian. Recently, a biodiversity decline probably caused by a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, was reported from all the three sea areas. In this study, we analyzed the anthropogenic impact of 9 human-derived pressures in the 10 ecoregions by the use of Cumulative Effect Assessment (CEA) methods. Aggregating the results in the sea areas, we found that the North Caspian shows higher average CEA scores compared to the Middle Caspian and the South Caspian. Furthermore, we detected differences in the anthropogenic pressure contribution to the CEA score among the sea areas: the North Caspian is mostly affected by poaching (46% of the CEA score), whereas the Middle and South Caspian by pollution (45% and 51%). This was further supported by the average ecoregion CEA scores, where the highest impact appears in the transitional ecoregion between the North and the Middle Caspian. This can pose a risk for the survival of the endemic species with the distribution limited only to the North Caspian. We propose that the potential explanation for the spatial pattern of the CEA score may be the pollution removal by water currents and the concentration of anthropogenic activities near river mouths. Finally, our study can be used as baseline for a reproducible spatially explicit environmental monitoring with the aim of implementing ecosystem management plans focused on the sustainable use of the Caspian Sea resources.</p>

                                            <p>The process of cocoa bean fermentation represents a key step in cocoa processing in terms of development of chocolate's flavor and aroma. Opposed to other fermentation processes in the food industry, it embraces a great complexity since it involves the sequential activation of mixtures of several microbial populations under non-controlled conditions. However, cocoa bean fermentation is a prototypical situation for the application of modelling by means of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations. Here, a quantitative model of cocoa bean fermentation is constructed based on available microbiological and biochemical knowledge. The model is formulated as a system of eight coupled ordinary differential equations where two types of state variables are distinguished: 1) Metabolite concentrations of glucose, fructose, ethanol, lactic acid and acetic acid, and 2) Population sizes of yeast, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria. By the use of a Bayesian framework for the estimation of the parameters, we demonstrate that the model is capable of quantitatively describe existing fermentation time series. Thus, the proposed model is a valuable tool towards a mechanistic understanding of this complex biochemical process.</p>

It applies general statistical principles for modeling and drawing conclusions about geostatistical problems. The aim of this project is to estimate parameters of the geostatistical model of meteorological data using both methods of robust and non-robust statistics and to compare these two approaches. The origin of the used data is the dataset ECA&amp;D (Europian Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset), that is distributed freely. For the analysis, data from Estonian meteorological station were used (temperature, the depth of snow etc.). Analyses are made in the environment of R-studio emphasizing the use of geoR and georob packages.</p>

                                            <p>This contribution outlines a process that makes all analysis and reporting steps reproducible and comprehensible. In addition, this procedure also allows flexible adaptation of analyses to individual requirements. The data analysis process is presented on the basis of the quality assurance process for task development in the context of the standardized school leaving exam in Austria. One aspect of quality assurance is the collection of data from pilot studies in which tasks are tested on a representative student population (BIFIE, 2013). After the respective exam, a post-test-analysis (pta) is performed, in which the exam results and given tasks are analysed. The interim and final data analyses require a flexible and quick reporting. In order to make data analyses and reporting independent of the data analyst, R packages were developed for both the piloting and the pta. They contain functionality for reading, cleaning and checking the (raw) data, as well as generating reports automatically. The reporting features are designed to be flexible enough to add or remove sections by specifying the appropriate function arguments to suit the needs of different recipients. Git was used as versioning tool. The documentation was written with bookdown, whereas the automatic report generation was implemented using LaTeX and knitr. In this poster presentation, the cycle of the report generation will be shown, technical details will be explained, the analyses steps will be clarified and exemplary tables/figures from pilots and pta reports will be presented.</p>

                                            <p>Our proposal of the poster is the case study of using R in hydrology. It is based on the following ideas. We will present the creation of a river flow generator, which uses as an inputs temperature and precipitation data. Our work points out the difference between two types of modelling: flow simulation and flow forecasting. In the case of the flow simulation (e.g., their generation in the future), flows from the days before the prediction cannot be used as the input data. They are simply not available when we want to generate flows in a river in future time horizons. Most studies on machine learning applications in rainfall-runoff modelling were flow-prediction studies, so this study will also re-evaluate the performance ratio of machine learning models versus hydrological modelling from point of view of real rainfall-runoff modelling. We emphasize word &quot;real&quot; in the previous sentence because prediction on the base of previous flows included in input data is basically just an extrapolation. To increase the accuracy of the flow simulation (or generation), the authors have designed and tested various variants of machine learning models, which will be evaluated and described on the poster together with R codes (keras, XGBoost, RF…). The proposed models are compared with the hydrological model (hydroTUW R package is used). The comparison is made on stream flows in Slovakia. hydroGOF package and other R packages are used for this purpose. The proposed approach which will be described on the poster allows for a significant increase in the accuracy of the flow simulation. As will be demonstrated in the case study, improvement in the precision of the modelling is significantly affected not only by the selection of model but also by hydrology-inspired feature engineering, hydrology-inspired feature selection, and the appropriate architecture of the entire modelling.</p>

                                            <p>Information technologies that generate different types of data associated with spatial localization have been promoted in the last decades. The optimal use of georeferenced data depends on the capacities for efficiently and simply analyzing spatial variability. To facilitate the implementation of univariate and multivariate algorithms for spatial data, a &quot;Spatial Statistics&quot; module was developed in the statistical software InfoStat using R. The development merges the best of the ease-to-use menu-driven in InfoStat with the power of R and includes procedures for spatial data pre-processing and analytics. Autocorrelation indexes, correlation coefficients, semivariograms, interpolation, principal components and clustering for spatial data can be performed throughout a dashboard. In addition, we develop the FastMapping app to automate interpolation and mapping of spatial variability. FastMapping automates the selection of the best geostatistical model for kriging prediction by cross-validation. The application was developed using the Shiny R package, and it is compatible with different browsers. The use of both developments is illustrated by the implementation of a logical sequence of algorithms to obtain a multivariate spatial variability map from a database of five soil variables intensively recorded in an agricultural field under precision agriculture.</p>

                                            <p>One important goal in survival analysis is the comparison of survival curves between groups. In many longitudinal survival studies one is often interested in assessing whether there are differences in survival among different groups of participants. For example, in a longitudinal medical study with a survival outcome, we might be interested in comparing survival between participants receiving different treatments, different age groups, racial/ethnic groups, geographic localization, etc. Several nonparametric methods have been proposed in the literature to test for the equality of survival curves for censored data. However, none of these methods can be used to determine groups among a series of survival curves. Naive approaches, such as pairwise comparisons, lead to a large number of comparisons making difficult the interpretations. Based on this, a new method is proposed which allows determining groups of survival curves with an automatic selection of their number. This method is implemented in the R <em>clustcurv</em> package and is illustrated using data from a colon cancer study.</p>

                                            <p>The Weibull distribution is frequently applied in various fields, ranging from economy, business, biology, hydrology, or engineering. This work deals with the development of an R-package, that aim at the two-parametric Weibull distribution, which is unique by using the method of quantiles and the one-way ANOVA (for example, the packages ExtDist a EWGoF, use the method of moments or estimation by maximum likelihood).</p>
                                            <p>R-package EstWeibull utilizes the Weibull model, exactly the two-parametric Weibull distribution. The package is developed for the estimation of random sample parameters using one of the following methods: method of quantiles, the maximum likelihood estimations, or Weibull probability plot. The package includes the goodness of fit test statistics for fully specified distribution and for composite hypothesis based on EDF statistic - the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the Anderson-Darling.</p>
                                            <p>The package also contains the parameter estimates by maximum likelihood method in one-way ANOVA type models - estimations for the model with constant scale parameter, constant shape parameter and the model with both parameters constant. The tests with nuisance parameters are included too - namely the score test, the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test, with null hypothesis that the parameter scale or shape is constant. We use stats and rootSolve packages.</p>

                                            <p>Being able to predict the degradation of concrete is important in economic, environmental and human safety point of view. An academic research project titled “Geochemical interactions of concrete in core samples, experiments and models” has begun in 2017 October which primarily aims to understand and/or simulate geochemical interactions (mineral dissolution and precipitation processes) in concrete–rock–water systems. One of the several research tools available for the prediction of these reactions is numerical geochemical modeling (based on chemical equations, equilibrium and rate constants). To support these experimentally validated theoretical models a data based solution is also explored by machine learning algorithms (empirical models), first, applied on a publicly available dataset. By the use of a neural network algorithm and the usually available data, the compressive strength of concrete is proven to be possible to estimate. Most of these works, however, primarily focus on the preparation of concrete (the mix) and its age (as predictors). By reproducing one of these study cases for the dataset ‘concrete’ in the R package ‘AppliedPredictiveModeling’, lessons to learn are collected for the improvement of the geochemical perspective project. Based on the experiences of this first analysis, a local dataset is expected to access which is suitable to predict concrete integrity even when affected by intense geochemical reactions like sulfate or acid attack.</p>

                            <p>We'll have a Welcome Reception and Poster Session on the workshop day (May 14), which is free and open to all conference attendees. Please note that although the workshops will take place at the Central European University, the Welcome Reception will take place in the Akvarium Klub, so you will have to walk ~500 meters (~5 minutes) between these two locations. Please see the below <a href="#venue">venues</a> section for more details.</p>
                            <p>The Conference Dinner (May 15) requires a separate ticket purchase (early-bird price of <strike>15,000</strike> 20,000 HUF / ~<strike>50</strike> 65 EUR) available at registration time, and will offer not only a good selection of foods and drinks, but a 2-hours long sightseeing boat tour on the Danube as well -- starting from the point marked with a "boat" on the below map in the <a href="#venue">venues</a> section. Please be prepared for a 1,000 meters (~10 mintes) walk from the conference venue. Note that the number of conference dinner tickets we can offer is very limited, make sure to get your conference ticket in time!</p>

                            <p>The workshop day will take place at the <a href="https://www.ceu.edu">Central European University</a> (see the "computer" icon on the map). This new building offers plenty of rooms for the tutorials -- ranging from small seminar rooms with 25 seats up to the big auditorium with up to 400 participants.</p>

                            <p>The second and third days of the conference will take place in the <a href="http://en.akvariumklub.hu/about-the-club">Akvarium Klub</a> (see the "folks" icon on the map), a few minutes walk from the workshops, located only a few hundred meters from the riverside of Danube, and right in the middle of the city center. This venue features a large concert hall with nearly 1300-capacity, a smaller hall, a bar, and a restaurant with unique atmosphere under a pool. In short, we'll have the perfect place for 2 or up to 3 parallel sessions and networking!</p>

Street parking is a bit cheaper: around 1.5 EUR per hour between 8am and 6pm, but there is a 3 hour restriction, so you have to move your car (?) and get a new ticket pretty frequently. On the other hand, Budapest has a dense network of public transport lines (even at night), so you might consider leaving your car behind (maybe at a free P+R spot) and taking the metro/underground instead. Sporty visitors may choose the <a href="http://molbubi.bkk.hu/">BUBI</a>, the public bike-sharing system.</p>

                            <h3>Smoking policy</h3>
                            <p>Smoking is banned in all enclosed public places, on public transport, and in all worplaces in Hungary. Regarding the conference venues, there will be a dedicated smoking area outside the building.</p>

                            <h3>Alcohol policy</h3>
                            <p>Entering the conference venue with any open or visible alcohol container is strictly prohibited. The consumption of alcoholic beverages is forbidden in the conference building except for beverages served as part of the official catering.</p>

                            <h3>Harassment policy</h3>
                            <p>This conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

                            <h2>Workshops</h2>
                            <p>Attendees are highly suggested to bring their own laptops, as no on-site computers will be available. Although we try to provide enough power outlets, but cannot guarantee that everyone will be able to charge all the computers at the same time, so we advise to bring a fully-charged laptop and share the power outlets with others.</p>
                            <p>Public WiFi will be available to all attendees with reasonable speed. Please note that only HTTP(S) traffic is allowed, so eg you cannot SSH to remote servers -- except using your own VPN network.</p>
                            <h2>Conference days</h2>
                            <p>Public WiFi will be available, although don't expect blazing fast connection -- this is a concert hall, so probably better to fall back to mobile broadband access if possible. Please note that only HTTP(S) traffic is allowed on the public WiFi, so eg you cannot SSH to remote servers -- except using your own VPN network.</p>
                            <p>Attendees can bring their own laptops, but please note that only limited number of power outlets will be provided in the concert halls -- so we advise to bring a fully-charged laptop and share the power outlets with others. Some tables in a separated silent area will be provided for those who would like to charge the laptops/phones while working from the conference venue.</p>
                            <h2>For Speakers</h2>
                            <p>Please note the above mentioned limitations on the public WiFi.</p>
                            <p>Presenters of workshops are advised that each workhop room is equipped with a large LCD screen or projector with HD resolution and HDMI connector. Presenters must bring their own laptops. Technical help will be available on-site on request. We suggest to arrive early to the venue (eg no later than 30 mins before your session) to make sure that everything is working as expected and ready for the workhop.</p>
                            <p>Speakers on the conference days are encouraged to bring a copy of the presentation in PDF format on a USB stick and to use the provided Mac for the presentation. If you may need to use your own computer for the presentation (eg for a live demo on a custom environment), it's possible to proxy the screen of your computer to the Mac via HDMI output. An IT/AV technician and conference assistants will be available on-site to help with any technical questions. Please see your session chair before the start of your session and check that your presentation works fine with the provided infrastructre.</p>
